# DeepLabV3-Drone-Imagery
DeepLab uses a special input format called TFRecords. Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to convert data into this format. It is highly recommended to read Mike Heavers repository for the creation of TFRecords. However, all the data has already been prepared for conversion in the Damage and Material Folder. The TFRecord files have also been created.

I included all the python files that had to be modified in the File change folder. These hat to be modified to be used on multi class detection on custom classes.
